## Project Description

For our project we decided to create an app that allows the user to create cocktails or mixed drinks based on the ingredients they select. The user will be able to look at whatever alcohol they have on hand or plan on purchasing, select that alcohol in the app, and generate a list of recipes for cocktails based on their selection. The app will also feature a map function where the user can search for liquor stores to find the nearest stores near them to purchase any ingredients they need.
